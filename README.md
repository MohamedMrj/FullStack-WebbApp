## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) (Python package manager)
- SQLite or another supported database (as defined in `database.py`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Configure the database connection in `database.py` by modifying the `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL` variable.
2. Run the FastAPI application:

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

3. Access the API documentation by navigating to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs) in your browser. You can use the interactive documentation (Swagger UI) to test the APIs.
